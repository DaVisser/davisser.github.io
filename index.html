        <h2>Where are you?</h2>
        <p>Hi! You found my personal website!

        <h2>Academics</h2>
        <p>
            I completed both my undergraduate and graduate studies at Clemson University, where I explored topics from 
            low-level C programming to cloud computing and human-centered design. During my junior year of undergraduate studies, ChatGPT released
            and started reshaping how people view my academic program. I personally have been shaped by a curiosity 
            for how people interact with technology and use it in ways that are useful, interesting, and thought provoking.
            I've worked on a variety of projects that challenged me to learn new tools and think creatively.
